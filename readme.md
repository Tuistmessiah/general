 - Check server-example for a sample project in express node.
 - Check frontend-example for a sample project in html/css/js.
 - Check nextjs-example for a sample project in NextJS, a framework for frontend that uses ReactJS, can use typescript and gives a lot of features out of the box.

Do not forget to run `npm install` inside the node and nextjs projects to install the local dependencies :)
